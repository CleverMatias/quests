As Spolsky's famous The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing argues, however, simple problems are just as good, or better. Simple problems test simple skills, and simple skills are the basis of complex ones. A programmer who struggles to loop through a bunch of words will be at sea performing far more complex tasks.
