This project is a exercise to keep my mind and fingers programming.

From time to time I search for some programming quests, questions from interviews, problems from dojos or puzzles and I try to give them the best and clean solution.

The majority here is PHP that is my main language, but I am trying to bring some new programming languages.

Thats it.. keep your fingers and your mind running...
